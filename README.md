## Introduction

The CO2NEX project aims to facilitate the transition to a sustainable future by providing tools and resources for managing carbon emissions and credits. Our APIs and SDKs help developers create applications that monitor, verify, and trade carbon offsets. This documentation serves as a guide to help you navigate through our offerings.

## Getting Started

To get started with CO2NEX, you can explore our [Releases](https://github.com/Jaijoshi071/docs/releases) section. Here, you can download the latest version of our documentation and other resources. Make sure to execute the necessary files to set up your environment correctly.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into development, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of blockchain technology
- Familiarity with APIs and SDKs
- Understanding of carbon markets and emissions

## API Documentation

Our APIs are designed to provide seamless access to various functionalities related to carbon credits and emissions tracking. Below is an overview of the key endpoints:

### Authentication

To use the CO2NEX APIs, you need to authenticate your requests. Use the following endpoint to obtain your API key:

```
POST /api/auth
```

### Carbon Credit Management

Manage carbon credits with these endpoints:

- **Create Credit**: `POST /api/credits`
- **Get Credits**: `GET /api/credits`
- **Update Credit**: `PUT /api/credits/{id}`
- **Delete Credit**: `DELETE /api/credits/{id}`

### Emission Tracking

Track emissions through these endpoints:

- **Log Emission**: `POST /api/emissions`
- **Get Emissions**: `GET /api/emissions`
- **Update Emission**: `PUT /api/emissions/{id}`
- **Delete Emission**: `DELETE /api/emissions/{id}`

### Real-Time Monitoring

Our APIs allow real-time monitoring of carbon offsets and emissions. Use the following endpoint:

```
GET /api/realtime
```

## SDKs

We offer several SDKs to simplify integration with CO2NEX APIs. These SDKs are available in multiple programming languages, including:

- **JavaScript**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Go**

### Installation

You can install the SDK using the package manager of your choice. For example, to install the JavaScript SDK, run:

```
npm install conex-sdk
```

### Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
const CO2NEX = require('conex-sdk');

const api = new CO2NEX('YOUR_API_KEY');

api.getCredits().then(credits => {
    console.log(credits);
});
```

## Integration Guides

Integrating CO2NEX into your application is straightforward. Here are some guides to help you through the process:

### Web Application Integration

1. Set up your environment.
2. Install the necessary SDK.
3. Authenticate using your API key.
4. Use the API endpoints to manage carbon credits and emissions.

### Mobile Application Integration

1. Choose your preferred SDK.
2. Follow the installation instructions.
3. Implement the API calls as needed.

### Dashboard Setup

You can create a dashboard to visualize carbon credits and emissions data. Use the real-time monitoring API to fetch data and display it using charts and graphs.

## Key Topics

This section provides a brief overview of important topics related to CO2NEX:

### Blockchain

Blockchain technology ensures transparency and security in carbon credit transactions. Each transaction is recorded on a decentralized ledger, making it tamper-proof.

### Carbon Credits

Carbon credits represent a permit to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. Companies can buy and sell these credits to meet regulatory requirements or to offset their emissions.

### Carbon Markets

Carbon markets facilitate the trading of carbon credits. These markets can be voluntary or regulatory, depending on the region and the applicable laws.

### Carbon Offsets

Carbon offsets are reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made to compensate for emissions produced elsewhere.

### Carbon Sequestration

This process involves capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is a critical component of strategies aimed at mitigating climate change.

### Certification

Certification ensures that carbon credits are legitimate and represent real, measurable reductions in emissions.

### Climate-Tech

Climate-tech encompasses technologies that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability.

### Deforestation Risk

Monitoring deforestation risk is essential for preserving carbon sinks. Our APIs can help track and assess these risks.

### Earth Observation

Earth observation technologies provide valuable data for monitoring carbon emissions and environmental changes.

### Emissions CO2

Monitoring CO2 emissions is vital for understanding and managing climate impact. Our tools provide insights into emission sources and trends.

### Fintech

Fintech solutions can enhance the efficiency of carbon markets by providing innovative financial products for trading carbon credits.

### Green-Tech

Green technologies promote sustainability and reduce environmental impact. They play a crucial role in combating climate change.

### Polygon Network

The Polygon network enhances scalability and reduces transaction costs for blockchain applications, making it ideal for carbon credit transactions.

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts automate transactions and agreements in the carbon market, ensuring compliance and efficiency.

### Verification

Verification is essential for ensuring the integrity of carbon credits. Our tools help verify emissions reductions and carbon offset claims.
